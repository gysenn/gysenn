# Project Template for a project using CSS, HTML, JS and PHP.

### Getting Started

Just [Use this template](https://github.com/Assyyn/simple_web_template/generate). Fill in a repository name and short description, and click 'Create repository from template'. This will allow you to create a new repository in your Github account, prepopulated with the contents of this project.

Now you can clone the project locally and work on it!

`git clone https://github.com/<user>/<youre_repo_name>.git`
